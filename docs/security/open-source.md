# Open and Permanent Code

At the core of our lottery system lies a commitment to transparency, security, and immutability. We believe that these principles are fundamental to building trust with our users and ensuring the long-term integrity of our platform.

## 📖 Open Source Commitment

All of our code is open source and freely available for anyone to review, analyze, or contribute to. We believe in the power of community-driven development and the security benefits that come from having many eyes on the code.

## 🏗️ Immutable Smart Contracts

Our smart contracts, once deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, are non-upgradable. This means:

- 🛑 Nobody can change the core functionality of the contracts
- 🔒 The rules of the lottery are set in stone
- 🤝 Users can trust that the system will continue to operate as intended

## 🛠️ Limited Administrative Functions

To maintain the highest level of decentralization and trustlessness, we've limited administrative capabilities to only two essential functions:

1. **Adjust Ticket Price** 🎟️
2. **Update VDF Function** 🔄

### Why Allow Ticket Price Changes?

The ability to adjust the ticket price is crucial for the long-term sustainability of the lottery. Here's why:

- 📈📉 Ethereum's price can be volatile
- 🌍 We want to ensure the lottery remains accessible to players worldwide
- 🔬 Price adjustments allow us to find the optimal balance between accessibility and prize pool size

Rest assured, any price changes will be thoroughly communicated to the community well in advance.

### The Importance of VDF Function Updates

The Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) is a critical component of our random number generation process. We've included the ability to update this function for one crucial reason:

- 🖥️ **Quantum Computing Resilience**: Our current implementation uses RSA-2048 for the modulus n. While this is secure against current computing capabilities, the advent of powerful quantum computers in the coming decades could potentially break this encryption.

By allowing VDF function updates, we ensure that:

- 🛡️ The lottery can adapt to future cryptographic challenges
- 🔐 We can implement even stronger security measures as technology evolves
- 🌟 The core principle of provable fairness is maintained for decades to come

## 🤝 Our Promise

While these administrative functions exist, we commit to:

- 📢 Full transparency in any changes made
- 👥 Community consultation before implementing updates
- 🔍 Providing detailed explanations and justifications for any modifications

Our goal is to balance the need for long-term adaptability with our commitment to decentralization and user trust. We believe this approach ensures that our lottery can stand the test of time while remaining true to its core principles of fairness and transparency.
