## Core Functionality

### Ticket Purchase

```solidity
function buyTickets(uint256[4][] calldata tickets) external payable
```

- Allows purchase of up to 100 tickets in one transaction
- Each ticket requires 4 numbers (3 main numbers + 1 etherball)
- Automatically tracks tickets for all prize tiers
- Emits `TicketPurchased` and `TicketsPurchased` events

### Drawing Process

1. Draw Initiation

```solidity
function initiateDraw() external
```

- Requires minimum prize pool (500 ETH)
- Requires minimum time period (1 week)
- Sets up security delay buffer
- Starts the next game

2. Random Value Setting

```solidity
function setRandom(uint256 gameNumber) external
```

- Uses Ethereum's PREVRANDAO for initial randomness
- Must be called after security buffer period

3. VDF Proof Submission

```solidity
function submitVDFProof(uint256 gameNumber, BigNumber[] memory v, BigNumber memory y) external
```

- Verifies VDF proof by calling the [VDF contract](smart-contracts/vdf-contract.md)
- Generates final winning numbers
- Sets game status to completed

4. Payout Calculation

```solidity
function calculatePayouts(uint256 gameNumber) external
```

- Calculates prizes for each tier
- Handles excess fee management
- Transfers remaining prize pool to next game
- Emits payout information

### Prize Claiming

```solidity
function claimPrize(uint256 gameNumber) external
```

- Allows winners to claim their prizes
- Supports multiple prize tier winnings
- Prevents double claiming
- Emits `PrizeClaimed` event

```solidity
function mintWinningNFT(uint256 gameNumber) external
```

- Available only to gold tier winners
- Mints unique NFT by calling the [NFT contract](smart-contracts/nft-contract)
- Emits `NFTMinted` event

### Difficulty Management

```solidity
function changeDifficulty() external
```

- Automatically adjusts difficulty based on win patterns
- Requires 3 consecutive games for adjustment
- Changes take effect after a delay
- Emits `DifficultyChanged` event

### Administrative Functions

- `setTicketPrice`: Schedules ticket price changes
- `setNewVDFContract`: Updates VDF contract with delay
- `setFeeRecipient`: Updates fee recipient address

### Query Functions

```solidity
function getCurrentGameInfo() external view returns (
    uint256 gameNumber,
    Difficulty difficulty,
    uint256 prizePool,
    uint256 drawTime,
    uint256 timeUntilDraw
)
```

```solidity
function getBasicGameInfo(uint256 startGameId, uint256 endGameId) external view returns (GameBasicInfo[] memory)
```

```solidity
function getDetailedGameInfo(uint256 gameId) external view returns (GameDetailedInfo memory)
```

```solidity
function getUserGameWinnings(uint256 gameNumber, address user) external view
```
