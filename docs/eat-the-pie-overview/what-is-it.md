- **Self-Executing**: Autonomous operations ensure continuous, tamper-proof gameplay.
- **Ethereum-Secured**: Leveraging the world's most robust blockchain for unparalleled security.

- **Global Access**: Participate from anywhere with just an Ethereum wallet.
- **Provably Fair**: Utilizes Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs) for truly random and tamper-proof number generation.
