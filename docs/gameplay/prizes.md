# Prize Pool

Prize pool is made up of all the ticket purchases for the game. Here's how the prize pool gets distributed:

## ðŸ’° Prize Categories

1. **Jackpot (60% of pool)** ðŸŒŸ: Requires all 4 numbers to be correct (in order)
2. **3 in-a-row (25% of pool)** ðŸ¥ˆ: Requires the first 3 numbers to be correct (in order)
3. **2 in-a-row (14% of pool)** ðŸ¥‰: Requires the first 2 numbers to be correct (in order)

## ðŸ§® Prize Distribution

- **Multiple Winners**: When there are multiple winners for a category, they share the prize pool for that category equally.
- **No Winners**: If there are no winners in a category, that portion of the prize pool gets transferred to the next game.
- **Cascading Wins**: Winning tickets are eligible for each category they qualify for. For example, a jackpot winner also wins the "3 in-a-row" and "2 in-a-row" prizes!

## ðŸ’¸ Fees

- A 1% fee is applied to the total prize pool, capped at 100ETH max. Any excess (above 100 ETH) goes towards the prize pool.

> **Example**: If the total pool is 15,000 ETH, the fee would be 100 ETH (not 150 ETH). The remaining 14,900 ETH would be distributed according to the prize categories.
