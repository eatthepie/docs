# Rules

Once the lottery starts, it never ends. When a game concludes, the next one begins automatically. As long as Ethereum runs, there will always be a game in play.

## 🕒 Game Duration and Prize Pool

- **Duration**: Each game lasts at least **1 week** ⏳
- **Minimum Prize**: A minimum of **500 ETH** 💰 must be in the pool for the drawing to occur

## 🎟️ Ticket Purchase

- **Cost**: Each ticket is **0.1 ETH** 💸
- **Quantity**: Buy as many as you want! 🛒 No limits!
- **Pick 4 Numbers** for each ticket 🎱🎱🎱🎱
- The range of numbers you can select from is based on the current difficulty (see [Odds of Winning](odds.md) for details) 🔄

## 🎰 Drawing, Winners and Payouts

- Once both the 1-week duration and 500 ETH thresholds are met, the drawing begins 🏁
- The process to reveal the random numbers is done through a secure VDF computation that can take several hours
- For more details on the drawing process, see the [Drawing section](drawing.md) 🔍
- Once complete: Winning numbers are revealed 🔓, payouts are calculated 🧮, and winners can claim prizes 🏆
- If nobody wins, the prize pool gets transferred to the current ongoing game
